---

## üß™ Initial Test

### Step 5: First Pipeline Run
- [ ] Made a small test change (e.g., updated README)
- [ ] Committed changes: `git commit -m "test: CI/CD pipeline"`
- [ ] Pushed to main: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Went to Actions tab: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui/actions`

- [ ] Can see tags for main images:
  - [ ] `latest`
  - [ ] `0.6.33-XXXXXX` (version + git hash)
- [ ] Can see tags for variants:
  - [ ] `latest-cuda`
  - [ ] `latest-ollama`
  - [ ] `latest-slim`

- [ ] Lists `linux/amd64`
- [ ] Lists `linux/arm64`

---

## üöÄ Test Pulling Images

### Step 10: Pull and Test Image
```bash
docker pull YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --name test-webui YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui:latest
```

- [ ] Image pulled successfully
- [ ] Container started without errors
- [ ] Can access at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Application loads correctly
- [ ] Stopped test container: `docker stop test-webui && docker rm test-webui`

---

## üìä Test Different Triggers

### Step 11: Test Dev Branch (Optional)
```bash
git checkout -b dev
echo "# Dev test" >> README.md
git add . && git commit -m "test: dev branch"
git push origin dev
```

- [ ] Workflow triggered for dev branch
- [ ] Images tagged with `:dev` created
- [ ] Can pull: `docker pull YOUR-USERNAME/open-webui:dev`

### Step 12: Test Version Release (Optional)
```bash
git checkout main
npm version patch
git push origin main --tags
```

- [ ] Workflow triggered for version tag
- [ ] GitHub Release created
- [ ] Version-specific tags created (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- [ ] `:latest` tag updated

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Helper Scripts

### Step 13: Test Helper Scripts

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\.github\deploy.ps1
```
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Menu displays correctly
- [ ] Can choose option 6 (Check CI/CD status)
- [ ] Browser opens to Actions page

**Linux/Mac Bash:**
```bash
chmod +x .github/deploy.sh
./.github/deploy.sh
```
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Menu displays correctly
- [ ] Can choose option 6 (Check CI/CD status)

---

## üìö Documentation

### Step 14: Review Documentation
- [ ] Read [QUICKSTART.md](.github/QUICKSTART.md)
- [ ] Bookmarked [CI-CD-SETUP.md](.github/CI-CD-SETUP.md) for reference
- [ ] Reviewed [PIPELINE-ARCHITECTURE.md](.github/PIPELINE-ARCHITECTURE.md) (optional)

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

### Step 15: Complete Health Check
- [ ] No errors in latest workflow run
- [ ] Images exist on DockerHub
- [ ] Can pull and run images locally
- [ ] Understand how to trigger builds
- [ ] Know where to find documentation
- [ ] Have helper scripts ready to use

---

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your CI/CD pipeline is fully operational when:

‚úÖ **GitHub Actions:**
- Workflows run without errors
- All jobs complete successfully
- Build time is reasonable (30-45 min first, 10-20 min subsequent)

‚úÖ **DockerHub:**
- Images appear with correct tags
- Multi-architecture support confirmed
- Images are pullable

‚úÖ **Local Testing:**
- Can pull images
- Can run containers
- Application works correctly

‚úÖ **Documentation:**
- Understand how to use pipeline
- Know how to troubleshoot issues
- Have quick reference guides

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
- [ ] Verified `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` matches DockerHub exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Verified `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` is correct and has Read & Write permissions
- [ ] Regenerated token if needed
- [ ] Updated GitHub secret with new token

### Issue: "Repository not found"
- [ ] Created `open-webui` repository on DockerHub
- [ ] Verified repository name is exactly `open-webui` (no typos)
- [ ] Checked repository is not private (or have Pro account)

### Issue: "Workflow file not found"
- [ ] Confirmed `.github/workflows/dockerhub-cicd.yaml` exists
- [ ] File is in correct directory structure
- [ ] File is committed and pushed to repository

### Issue: Build times out or fails
- [ ] Checked GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- [ ] Verified DockerHub has enough storage (5GB free tier)
- [ ] Tried re-running the workflow
- [ ] Checked if DockerHub service is operational
